			 <p>My eternal Mother,</p>
<p>Where do I begin and what do I say? Even as this humble human heart throbs in gratitude for the countless benedictions benevolently bestowed at your compassionate feet, many a doubt linger at the far corners of this questioning mind. After I spent over 30 years in the warm and tender embrace of your nurturing soil at last I manage to face my fears and take the plunge.</p>
<p>In writing to you I endeavor to understand the intricacies of my own existence while your infinite wisdom dispels the ignorance of my insignificance in the grand scheme of things. No words would suffice to express how greatly I feel about you. However, I feel morally obligated to write to you now more than ever as you are going through the mostly incredible time of your everlasting life.</p>
<p>I want to know mother how you came to be a true paradise of paradox. In you all the polar opposites seem to co-exist. It never seizes to amaze me, why would you nurture selfless souls who live for the sake of others while allowing corrupt crooks to thrive? Even as I attribute it to motherly compassion, I am confounded by the disparity of wealth distribution in your very home. How can you let a few loathe in richness while the many suffer their poverty in silence?</p>
<p>How is it that you make allowance for the hopes of hardworking heroes dashed while the dreams of the fortunate few are fulfilled? I can understand you giving birth to sons and daughters who further the frontiers of music and mathematics, but why bother to nurture terrorists and tyrants? How then do you ensure justice is served when injustice is rampant? On the one hand we as a nation strive for greatness while on the other we reek of meekness help me make sense of these confluence of conflicts.</p>
<p>Are you a but a mere fleeting mirage or an eternal unchanging reality? Am I to feel elated when the greatness of your glory soars over Himalayan heights or devastated when the character of my nation sinks into oceanic depths? It is incredibly gratifying to see you clad in pristine rivers and bejeweled with magnificent mountains. But then, I fail to reconcile all the impurities your children add-on to your clothes all the dents they cause into your ornaments. Is it greed or survival? Is it ignorance or innocence?</p>
<p>For all the questions that confound me, I would not have it any other way. For you are in me as much as I am in you; a culmination of contradictions and a miracle of creation. I am grateful to you for the gift of love, for the spark of life and for the light of knowledge that was vouchsafed upon me by the sole virtue of being born to you. Thank you for giving this opportunity to write to you and seek your blessings. Hope to hear from you sometime in the eternity.</p>
<p>Yours Forever,</p>
<p>Loving Child</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>For Whitehat Jr how do you improve the connect between the candidates and tutors after the first call?</p>
<p>Comprehend the Situation</p>
<p><strong>What</strong> : The conversion rate after the demo call is below satisfactory levels</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong>:</p>
<p>The children are <em>not</em> happy with the tutor
The parents are <em>not</em> happy with the tutor</p>
<p><strong>Clarifying questions</strong>:</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the duration of the demo?</p>
<p>Whats the structure?</p>
<p>Is there interaction?</p>
<p>Is there an internet connectivity issue?</p>
<p>What does the tutor focus on merely showcasing knowledge or building rapport?</p>
<h3 id="identify-the-customer">Identify the Customer</h3>
<p><em><strong>Customer: Parents of young children - since they are ones paying</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Note: The purist in me wants to say the child/learner is the customer, I would like to take a different path and want the reviewers to expound on the merits or lack thereof of this approach of identifying the customer. *</p>
<p>Also, in principle should the customer be the one using the product or the one paying for it(when they are different)? Example in the case of B2B product etc?</p>
<h3 id="report-the-cxs-needs">Report the CX&rsquo;s Needs</h3>
<p><strong>Assumption</strong>: the parent would assess whether the below objectives are met in the demo session by the tutor as far as the child is concerned.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is well behaved - polite and patient</li>
<li>Knowledgeable and able to transfer that knowledge according to age, inclination and aptitude of the child</li>
<li>Keeps the child engaged - through interaction</li>
<li>Enjoys and has fun interacting with the kids and vice-versa</li>
<li>Ensures learning is happening - through retention and recall</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cut-through-prioritization">Cut, through prioritization</h3>
<p>First priority,</p>
<p><strong>Enjoys and has fun interacting with the kids and vice-versa</strong></p>
<p>If the child is having fun,</p>
<p>It will stay engaged and it will learn. It will continue to do so for long periods of time consistently. Also, it becomes a pull where the child learns without any sense of conscious effort and is therefore likely to want to learn more and remain interested much longer than otherwise.</p>
<p>Next thing would be,</p>
<p>Is well behaved - polite and patient</p>
<p>The third,</p>
<p>Knowledgeable and able to transfer that knowledge according to age, inclination and aptitude of the child</p>
<h3 id="list-all-solutions">List All Solutions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Educate the tutors about learning pedagogy and on nuances of interacting with and educating kids</li>
<li>Seek feedback from those who didn&rsquo;t sing-up on why they did not with open ended questions</li>
<li>Improve on those and iterate</li>
<li>Keep an initial rapport building or get to know your customer session where the child and parent can share what they want and tailor the demo accordingly</li>
<li>Work towards making the tutors more kind and compassionate human beings and distill the wisdom on why its good,</li>
<li><em><strong>Incentivize the tutors for genuine interaction and not merely for closing the sale</strong></em>. Provide them autonomy and flexibility on how they want to do it and for how long. Encourage them to be collaborators and not competitors by sharing their learning and experience from interacting with other prospects.</li>
<li>Improve the quality of leads and prospects, thereby investing effort in client that are more likely to convert</li>
<li>Allow tutors to be open and honest about the limitations of their platform and service - parents are able to see through promises that are too good to be true</li>
<li>Provide time for parents to voice their concerns or queries and educate tutors on how to address them</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="evaluating-trade-offs">Evaluating trade-offs</h3>
<p>Given enough resources (funding, time) and pain tolerance - ability to withstand temporary setback</p>
<p>I would recommend solution 6.</p>
<p><strong>Incentivize the tutors for genuine interaction and not merely for closing the sale. Provide them autonomy and flexibility on how they want to do it and for how long. Encourage them to be collaborators and not competitors by sharing their learning and experience from interacting with other prospects.</strong></p>
<h3 id="summarize-your-recommendation">Summarize your recommendation</h3>
<p>With the core vision of transforming the online education landscape and not just making a quick buck, one can see a much deeper concern that can be addressed using the above problem statement as a starting point.</p>
<p>Which is to enjoy the process of learning and being able to have fun while doing it.</p>
<p>With that in mind, <strong>I would recommend incentivizing the tutors (possibly through equity ownership or ESOP) to build relationships and not approach the process with a transactional mindset</strong></p>

			 <p>Some years ago, in the early stages of my career, there was a question posed to all the participants in the training session.</p>
<p>The question was, if you could any super power, what would it be and why?</p>
<p>Many people gave a variety of answers, some interesting, some predictable.</p>
<p>When I had a chance to speak, I said I would make everyone happy forever.</p>
<p>While being dismissed as impossible but good idea. I was asked the proverbial why?</p>
<p>I said, if you are happy, nothing else matters and if you are not, nothing matters then either!</p>
<p>Coming to think of it, it was not a bad superpower to have and probably much needed now.</p>
<p>It was only much later that I discovered that the great John Lennon echoed my words of wisdom ‚ò∫Ô∏è</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down &lsquo;happy&rsquo;. They told me I didn&rsquo;t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn&rsquo;t understand life.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Came across this beautiful poem by reading <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/06/28/may-sarton-the-work-of-happiness/">Marginalian</a></p>
<p>I thought of happiness, how it is woven
Out of the silence in the empty house each day
And how it is not sudden and it is not given
But is creation itself like the growth of a tree.
No one has seen it happen, but inside the bark
Another circle is growing in the expanding ring.
No one has heard the root go deeper in the dark,
But the tree is lifted by this inward work
And its plumes shine, and its leaves are glittering.</p>
<p>So happiness is woven out of the peace of hours
And strikes its roots deep in the house alone:
The old chest in the corner, cool waxed floors,
White curtains softly and continually blown
As the free air moves quietly about the room;
A shelf of books, a table, and the white-washed wall ‚Äî
These are the dear familiar gods of home,
And here the work of faith can best be done,
The growing tree is green and musical.</p>
<p>For what is happiness but growth in peace,
The timeless sense of time when furniture
Has stood a life‚Äôs span in a single place,
And as the air moves, so the old dreams stir
The shining leaves of present happiness?
No one has heard thought or listened to a mind,
But where people have lived in inwardness
The air is charged with blessing and does bless;
Windows look out on mountains and the walls are kind.</p>

			 <p>also the one you don&rsquo;t ask enough&hellip;</p>
<p>Have you been around 3 or 5 year old kids or are a parent of one?</p>
<p>If yes, then you would observe something interesting. They are compulsive Why&rsquo;ers or atleast most of them start out that way.</p>
<p>That is, all 5-year olds ask one question, <em>again and again and again</em>.</p>
<p>WHY??</p>
<p>I tell her not to eat chocolates, her response: why papa?</p>
<p>Other day we were all watching a üé• together and an actress was crying üò≠, she asked, why is she crying? I</p>
<p>We had to stop at the red light, and while we wait, she fired her why weapon a few times.</p>
<p>Why was the car red?</p>
<p>Why are so many folks on the road?</p>
<p>Why were there pot holes on the road? She answered this as well, saying I think they didn&rsquo;t construct it properlyü§£</p>
<p>I told her not to touch power sockets and her response was, you guessed it, why Papa?</p>
<p>The curiosity of a kid is wonderful (for the kind of questions) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSGf_vVKoI8">torturous</a> (because you know you will not have answers) at the same time.</p>
<p>While the inevitable institutionalisation (schooling &amp; society) is likely to drive out some of the curiosity out of every child, it may not be too late for us to stop.</p>
<p>Take a step back.</p>
<p>And ask <em><strong>why</strong></em>,  more often than we presently do.</p>
<p>After all, accomplished author and speak Simon Sinek became world famous, pivoted his career and had the breakthrough insight to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4">Start With Why</a></p>
<p>Or if you are still wondering why should you still worry about why! Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlYkx41wEE">Taiichi Ohno</a> the father of Toyota production system.</p>
<p>German philospher, Friedrich Nietzsche had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are still not convinced, here&rsquo;s another quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson an American philospher and essayist to ponder upon especially if you (like me) are working for a boss and might be one someday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The man who knows how will always have a job.
The man who knows why will always be his boss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides, he (she in this case) who has the last <em>why</em> also has the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSGf_vVKoI8&amp;t=4s">last laugh</a></p>

			 <p>While being stuck in traffic I saw a bunch of kids in a school playing by themselves.</p>
<p>One game in particular caught my attention. There was this one guy standing in the middle of the ground with his back bent. All the other boys would just run up to him, place their palms on his back and just jump over him.</p>
<p>He was happy and they were too.</p>
<p>It made me wonder what this would look like out there in the real world? Would one of them be the victor and the other the vanquished?</p>
<p>My spiritual master once told me. It&rsquo;s not enough to just be good but you&rsquo;ve to also be strong otherwise you will be exploited and get crushed.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Arthur Ashe was the first African-American male player to have won three grandslam titles and inspired a generation of athletes.</p>
<p>He had a heart attack which forced him retire from professional tennis. He contacted HIV AIDS diring blood transfusion on the second bout of heart attack.</p>
<p>When he shared this news with the world he recieved letters from fans all over.</p>
<p>One of which read: &ldquo;Why does GOD have to select you for such a bad disease‚Äù?</p>
<p>To which Arthur&rsquo;s response was both touching and wise.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe world over ‚Äî 50 million children start playing tennis,</p>
<p>5 million learn to play tennis,</p>
<p>500,000 learn professional tennis,</p>
<p>50,000 come to the circuit,</p>
<p>5000 reach the grand slam,</p>
<p>50 reach Wimbledon,</p>
<p>4 to the semifinal,</p>
<p>2 to the finals,</p>
<p>When I was holding a cup I never asked GOD ‚ÄòWhy me?‚Äô.</p>
<p>And today in pain I should not be asking GOD ‚ÄòWhy me?‚Äô ‚Äú</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Happiness keeps you Sweet,</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Trials keep you Strong,</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Sorrow keeps you, Human,</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Failure keeps you humble and</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Success keeps you glowing, but only Faith &amp; Attitude Keeps you going..‚Äù</p>
<p>Sometimes you are not satisfied with your life, while many others in this world are dreaming of living your life.</p>
<p>A child on a farm sees a plane fly overhead dreams of flying, while a pilot on the plane sees the farmhouse and dreams of returning home.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs Life! Enjoy yours‚Ä¶Because;</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ If wealth is the secret to happiness, then rich should be dancing on streets, but only POOR kids do that.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ If power ensures security, then VIPs should walk unguarded. But those who live simply sleep soundly</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ If beauty and fame bring ideal relationships, celebrities should have the best marriages</p>
<p>Therefore, live simply, Be happy, Walk humbly &amp; Love genuinely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spent his final years raising awareness of HIV AIDS and helping the victims through his foundation.</p>

			 <p>a story worth telling. Of course some more than others. After all, we are nothing more than the stories we tell ourselves.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, then why not tell a good one? Better still is the best story we can tell us about ourselves, this probably helps us live our best lives more than anything else.</p>
<p>This is also why movies and books, especially the biographical ones, have such a transformative effect on the lives of individuals however it can be short-lived if not coupled with intrinsic motivation.</p>

			 <p>It ceases to amaze you.</p>
<p>When learning something new,</p>
<p>Be it an idea, a skill, a tool (hardware/software), playing a game or a üé∂ instrument or picking up a new hobby.</p>
<p>We are nervous and excited at the same time. Constantly thinking about it in theüöø or before going to üò¥ and all the time in between.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Recently watched an excellent Interview (link at the end) of @Elon Musk by <a href="https://micro.blog/Lex">@Lex</a> Friedman.
‚Äã
And as Lex rightly pointed out in his opening remarks, Elon is someone who has given hope back to humanity in a bunch of different ways. Even more so in these tough times.
‚Äã
I also noticed that, Elon has a few key ideas that he often talks about in most of these enriching conversations.
‚Äã
Attempting to take a quick look at some of them in here.
‚Äã</p>
<h2 id="orders-of-magnitude">Orders of Magnitude</h2>
<p>‚Äã
Simply means, in powers of 10. An order of magnitude is 10X times and two orders of magnitude is 100X and so on&hellip;
‚Äã
Elon says, a new product or service has to be much better, by orders of magnitude for the consumer to switch from incumbents or its not enough incentive to switch.
‚Äã</p>
<h2 id="on-balance">On Balance</h2>
<p>‚Äã
All things considered. Most things in life are neither completely good nor bad. There are shades of gray to almost everything.
‚Äã
One needs to decide how much gray one is okay with to take action or make decisions.
‚Äã
Musk&rsquo;s individual carbon emissions might be higher than most ordinary individuals but his contribution to sustainable energy future more than offsets for this on balance.
‚Äã</p>
<h2 id="eating-glass-and-staring-into-the-abyss">Eating Glass and Staring Into the Abyss</h2>
<p>‚Äã
This is how he says, a friend of his describes starting a company feels like.
‚Äã
Elon&rsquo;s advice was, ‚ÄúIf you need inspiring words don&rsquo;t do it.‚Äù
‚Äã</p>
<h2 id="thinking-in-the-limits">Thinking in the Limits</h2>
<p>‚Äã
This is about looking at the extremes. From the atom to the universe lets say. Do things behave or work out differently in very small numbers or very large ones?
‚Äã
Also, things like when a product is manufactured in large numbers does it cost less due to economies of scale etc.
‚Äã
Interestingly, he said a Govt. is a corporation in the limit with a monopoly on violence.
‚Äã</p>
<h2 id="money-">Money üí∞üíµ</h2>
<p>‚Äã
Elon surely is uniquely qualified than most of us to talk about money being the richest man and all that. Also because of his work with PayPal.
‚Äã
Money is not valuable in and of itself. It serves as a means to allocate labor.
‚Äã
Its an entry in a database, with mainframes that run COBOL and central banks having editing permissions to the DB.
‚Äã</p>
<h2 id="area-under-the-curve">Area under the curve</h2>
<p>‚Äã
Area under the Curve  = ‚à´ab f(x)dx
‚Äã
Elon&rsquo;s life and work is classic example of the utility optimization function going full throttle.
‚Äã
If one can create a product or service that brings happiness or improves the quality of life of a large number of people in some small way or has a huge positive impact on a small number of people, its success is highly probable.
‚Äã</p>
<h2 id="rate-of-innovation">Rate of Innovation</h2>
<p>‚Äã
In the long run, the survival and then growth of a company is determined primarily by its rate of innovation.
‚Äã
This is important even for our individual careers, the degree to which we stay relevant is determined by the extent of our learning, unlearning and relearning.
‚Äã</p>
<h2 id="fundamental-breakthrough-or-holy-grail">Fundamental Breakthrough or Holy Grail</h2>
<p>‚Äã
Elon is known to correctly identify and relentlessly pursue fundamental breakthroughs in his chosen areas.
‚Äã
When it comes creating a self-sustaining civilization on mars, the key was to have fully and rapidly reusable rockets.
‚Äã
When it comes to autonomous cars it was solving for computer vision and so on.

			 <p>A long time ago.</p>
<p>Wait!</p>
<p>Actually, not so long ago! When I was in 7th Std and my sister was in 2nd we
would have what we then called <strong>deep discussions.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, along with our dad, we even had a group (not on what&rsquo;s app, we just
called ourselves that), called <strong>Smriti</strong></p>
<p>We grew up in a village with no access to electricity, let alone a TV or
internet so we spent time reading and talking to real (not virtual) people.</p>
<p>During those <em>deep discussions</em> whenever my sis asked me a question, more
often than not, my answer would almost always start with a phrase, yes you
guessed it right, <em><strong>it depends</strong></em>.</p>
<p>I think this <a href="https://wisdomshare.com/stories/destiny-in-our-hands/">story</a>
elucidates the the point I am trying to make, much better than I ever could.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this again off late. It was triggered by a
conversation with a good friend. Who seemed to think of it as an act of escapism or
a copout.</p>
<p>I on the contrary, feel that its a mere acknowledgement of the complexity of
the nature of truth, our existence and its meaning of perception &amp;
perspective and various other subjective, messy topics.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Its a humble admittance of my own ignorance.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>More optimistically, its my genuine belief.</p>
<p>Because, <a href="https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2018/11/26/descartes-i-think-therefore-i-am/">I
THINK</a> and have to come to believe it more with each passing
day. That, there is no such thing as absolute truth or atleast not until you
know it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>What is true, depends on you</strong> and truth, no matter how profound or
enticing, when its not yours (experential) still remains untruth. Thats also why
most people have a hard time believing, let alone relating to the hard things
that happen to <em>other people</em> in their lives but have vivid recollection of
whatever happened to them in their own lives decades ago and continue to
view the world from that same lens shaped by their one experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what
you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.
~Maya Angelou</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take any question, and try to think through it and come up with a convincing
answer and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean.</p>
<p>These are some questions I can&rsquo;t help but start the answer with it depends.</p>

<p>It seems like a settled one but it depends on how you measure, isn&rsquo;t it?
Some say Rod Laver, others like to go with Roger Federer. But, how do you
decide by the number of Grandslam wins? Titles? Matches? Weeks as number one?</p>
<p>What about the times in which they played? The quality of opponents? The
role of tech? Global and geo-political situations?</p>

white, the truth is that often, they are fifty (or a million shades) of
gray.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/42/">While its important, essential even, to ask questions for they matter much
more than the actual answers. I think, an attempt to find absolute answers
to relative, subjective and eternally evolving questions and their context is
IMHO at best an exercise in
futility</a>.</p>

			 <p>I do think about this from time to time.</p>
<p>Although, I don&rsquo;t think I have an answer, I certainly think it&rsquo;s a question worth pondering together.</p>
<p>Is it a means to an end? If yes, to what end?</p>
<p>Is it the ultimate aim of life? The pinnacle of human aspiration is to make more money?</p>
<p>Is it freedom? Financial or otherwise?</p>
<p>Is it just a piece of paper with some numbers and symbols?</p>
<p>Is it power?</p>
<p>Elon talks about money in a few different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a means of labour allocation</li>
<li>As an entry in a database</li>
<li>As a mechanism for information transfer etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naval speaks of money as a form of leverage along with capital and code. Although he regards code as <a href="https://www.wealest.com/articles/leverage">superior</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, he was also wise enough to state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money won‚Äôt solve all your problems, but it will solve all your money problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, can money buy you time?</p>
<p>The answer is YES &amp; NO</p>
<p>Yes, in the sense that you can rent other people&rsquo;s time for a price. That&rsquo;s where the means of labour allocation comes from!</p>
<p>No in the sense that , not all the wealth in the üåç can buy someone a moment in time once it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>How do you think and feel about money?</p>
<p>Do you rever it above all else? Or treat it with measured indifference or fall somewhere in between?</p>

<p>The word &lsquo;<em>Guru</em>&rsquo; is from Sanskrit, where &lsquo;<em>Gu</em>&rsquo; means darkness and <em>&lsquo;Ru&rsquo;</em> means dispeller.</p>
<p>The darkness here means the ignorance of illusion(maya) and only a realized master&rsquo;s blessings can elevate such a soul to the supreme knowledge of self and god.</p>
<p>It is said that the <em>guru</em> appears when the <em>shishya</em> is ready. I do not know if I was or will ever be ready. However, I (completely and unconditionally) trust the guru&rsquo;s appearance in their infinite compassion and wisdom to mean that I am <em>ready</em>.</p>
<p>Kabir Das, the great saint, mystic and poet of the 15th century placed Guru even above God in his Doha.</p>

<p>If Guru and Govind, are present before me, to whom shall I bow down first? Glory to the Guru since he showed me Govind.</p>
<p>India is the land of the Guru-Shishya parampara, where the teachers and students share a special and unique bond. Guru Purnima is a celebration of that bond.</p>
<p>It is also known as Vyasa Purnima in remembrance and gratitude to the greatest of sages Veda Vyasa,  who wrote the Mahabharata and the Puranas and classified the Vedas into four categories.</p>
<p>On this auspicious day of Guru Purnima let us live in gratitude to all those who imparted knowledge in all aspects of life especially those who have blessed and guided us on our spiritual journey of self discovery, our parents, our teachers, mentors and colleagues.</p>
<p>I have been blessed with one such spiritual master who has been an embodiment of compassion, unconditional love, courage and an unshakable faith in god under the most difficult situations with a remarkable ability to treat one and all equally at all times.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On an mundane weekend while I was flipping through TV channels I chanced upon some old cricket highlights followed by more business media noise. That‚Äôs when a quirky thought crossed my mind.</p>
<p>As I pursued this rabbit hole even further, I could see some parallels between the game of cricket and the world of Investing. This is by no means a perfectly rational analogy but a mere fun exercise in trying to recognize patterns and seek order in a world full of chaos and replete with randomness.</p>
<p>On the basis of ones time horizons the participants in the game of cricket or in the craft of investing can be split into three categories. Long (Test), medium (ODI) and short term (T20).</p>
<p>Just as there are three formats in the game of cricket, three types of men and women flock the world of investing.</p>
<h2 id="test-cricketers-and-value-investors">Test Cricketers and Value Investors</h2>
<p>These are folks who are a purists delight and epitomize excellence in their respective domains. They focus invariably on the process and believe that the results take care of themselves. Patience and perseverance are necessary ingredients in the making of a successful test cricket or value investing career. While the former credits his performance to technical proficiency and deliberate practice in the formative years the latter attribute their massive wealth creation to rigorous fundamental analysis and fortitude to go against the herd when required.</p>
<p>Both are perpetual learning machines and humble to a fault. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule. Every now and then you come across individuals who are cocky as hell and believe they know it all. Only to realize soon, how gravely wrong they were. Maybe there‚Äôs a reason why test cricket made Sir Don the game‚Äôs greatest and the value way made Warren one of history‚Äôs richest ever.</p>
<h2 id="t20-superstars-and-day-traders-dreamers">T20 Superstars and Day Traders (Dreamers)</h2>
<p>This is the risk of the realm of the adrenaline junkies and the get rich quick seers of short cuts. Higher risk and lower room for error writ large in this unguarded adventure. While the former is all about sheer power and thrives on glitz &amp; glamour, the latter counts on margin money to make them rich. While most aspiring T20 greats have  their careers cut short by wrong technique and lack of discipline the speculators lose their shirt and throw-in the towel. Both are sore losers and blame the game and the markets for the disaster they brought upon themselves.</p>
<p>Heard of the likes of Lasith Malinga and Jesse Livermore? One lost his career while the other lost his fortune and tragically succumbed to suicide. Though on balance T20 has done more good to the game than trading has done to man‚Äôs mission for wealth creation.</p>
<p>Then comes the third category, which possibly includes some of us or so we hope.</p>
<h2 id="the-moderates-on-the-middle-path">The Moderates on the Middle Path</h2>
<p>These are people who don‚Äôt fall into either of the extremes. While the players hang around for 8 hours to get a result, the investors (if you can call them that) pull the trigger sometime between three months to three years. These are people who are neither play with fire nor are boring to the bone. Both the length of the game and the investing horizon is temperamentally palatable for most people. But then the preferred duration for a game of cricket and the turn-around time for stocks are hitting new lows with each passing day.</p>
<p>Remember Michael Bevan? He was a quintessential ODIer. In investing, if you have held stocks, now‚Äôs the time to hold up a mirror:)</p>
<h2 id="forth-and-final--the-rarest-breed">Forth and Final ‚Äì The Rarest Breed</h2>
<p>Then there is the rarest crop that harvests not too often in the history of any human endeavor. These are the true masters of the game endowed with an abundance of god-given talent coupled with an incredible work ethic which makes them truly great. Our very own Virat Kohli and Rakesh Jhunjhunwala are active specimens of this finest breed.</p>

<p>Icarus&rsquo;s dad also told him not to fly too low or his weight would sink him in the sea.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>The more I practice, the luckier I get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~Gary Player</p>
<p>How would you know if someone is successful because of skill or luck?</p>
<p>Depends on what&rsquo;s the pursuit that we are trying to evaluate.</p>
<p>Most human endeavours lie somewhere on this luck <em>vs.</em> skill spectrum.</p>
<p>Some areas such as a casino or a Russian roulette are pure luck driven.</p>
<p>While others such as elite professional sport would skew more towards skill.</p>
<p>In investing (especially equity) most people who are successful in the long run, acknowledge some or in most cases a meaningful role of luck.</p>
<p>Charlie Munger opines that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want. The world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a whole bunch of undeserving people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naval Ravikant on the other üëè <a href="https://podcastnotes.org/naval-periscope-sessions/naval-nivi-5/">talks</a> about four kinds of luck.</p>
<ol>
<li>Blind luck ‚Äì ‚Äúdumb luck‚Äù</li>
<li>Luck that comes to you through persistence ‚Äì ‚Äúfortune favors the bold‚Äù</li>
<li>Spotted luck ‚Äì ‚Äúchance favors the prepared mind‚Äù</li>
<li>Luck that finds you - luck by design - Destiny</li>
</ol>
<p>Our normal tendency is to attribute our success to skill or effort and our failures to luck or karma or what have you&hellip;</p>
<p>Is there a way to tell?</p>
<p>Turns out, there is!</p>
<p>In fact, Michael Mauboussin in his excellent üìñ <strong>Untangling Skill and Luck in Business, Sports, and Investing</strong> digs deeper into this very question and provides some interesting answers.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more before reading the book, here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://youtu.be/1JLfqBsX5Lc">talk</a> he gave at Google elucidating some of the ideas in the üìñ</p>
<p>One of the heuristics to determine if it is luck or skill that made someone successful is to see if you can <em><strong>fail on purpose</strong></em>.</p>
<p>If you can, then the role of <em>skill</em> is significant.</p>
<p>If you ask me, I would any day prefer to be lucky over skilled. As you would need some amount of luck even for the skill to play out as my wife rightly pointed out!</p>
<p>What about you? Would you rather be lucky or skilled?</p>

<p>One of my favourite üí° of his is the idea of <strong>antifragile</strong>.</p>
<p>Simply put, it&rsquo;s not something that just is resilient to or merely able to withstand disorder or chaos but on the contrary benefits from it and becomes better from it.</p>
<p>Imagine how being antifragile can help us in various walks of life, be it career, health, finance or just in terms of thinking and becoming a better human being.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure , risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781365110467">On the Shortness of Life</a> by Seneca üìö</p>
<p>One of the most profound books ever! Also, one of the shortest. At around 11000 words, takes about a couple of hours or so to read.</p>
<p>This is one the those <em>Antifragile</em> books. One that has truly stood the test of time. Written 2 millenia ago by a roman stoic philosopher who&rsquo;s life was indeed a <a href="https://dailystoic.com/seneca/">tale worth telling</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a few snippets from the book to read and reflect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much of it. Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things if the whole of it is well invested.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The part of life we really live is small. For all the rest of existence is not life, but merely time.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So desirable a thing did leisure seem that he anticipated it in thought because he could not attain it in reality</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There is nothing the busy man is less busied with than living: there is nothing that is harder to learn</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The fairest day in hapless mortals‚Äô life
Is ever first to flee.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I hear that one of these pampered people‚Äîprovided that you can call it pampering to
unlearn the habits of human life‚Äîwhen he had been lifted by hands from the bath and placed in his sedan-chair, said questioningly: ‚ÄúAm I now seated?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>They lose the day in expectation of the night, and the night in fear of the dawn.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>-Lucius Annaeus Seneca</p>
<p>Personally, I also feel it resonates closely with the perfect Yogic wisdom of revered scripture <strong>Srimad Bhagavad Gita</strong>.</p>
<p>If you read only one thing this weekend, let it be this great book!</p>

			 <p>Rocky Bhai and KGF chapter 2 is all the rage at the moment.</p>
<p>After all, he is the biggest national issue right now!</p>
<p>While its surely a treat for the üìΩÔ∏è goers, here are a few things we can hope to learn from it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Greed is (not)good
Though Rocky makes progress and also creates history, it doesn&rsquo;t all end very well for him. Atleast not yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed Matters
The pace at which Rocky went gold digging ü§£ was (while greedy) an epitome of efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t talk, show the work
Its not what he says(although he surely talks a good game too) but what he does that makes him a force of nature among friends and foes alike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your word is everything
When asked about his obsession and the reason for doing everything, he goes on to explain how much the promise he made to his dying mother mattered to him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overcoming your fear is the ultimate test
His courage gives people hope. Following his example they are not only willing to sacrifice their lives but are also prepared to kill for him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Powerful people make places powerful
Most people are a product of their environment however a few who transcend it can shape the destiny of the time and space they power over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing is greater than a mother&rsquo;s ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A mothers love and blessing is for sure the greatest thing in ones life.</p>
<p>All that he is, is because of her:
- his courage
- his respect for women
- his extent of honoring his word</p>
<p>How remarkably well the movie captures this emotion, this experience is surely one of the üóùÔ∏è reasons for its success.</p>
<p>This is also why KGF2 is not just a movie but a movement.</p>

			 <p>Through stories.</p>
<p>My grandfather and especially my dad would tell me stories all the time. Stories from Ramayana and Mahabharata. Stories from their life and experience. Stories they heard from people. Stories from all the novels, magazines and other books they would read.</p>
<p>Like most kids I started reading comics and loved all their super powers. When I read a comic version of Ramayana I thought it would be nice to be like <em>Vali</em>, getting half of your opponent&rsquo;s power in a fight.</p>
<p>I had fun and it also seemed to make me smarter before my friends and elders. This got me interested and led me to read more. As expected, I got better at school too.</p>
<p>I started reading the books that I saw my dad read during the day and share stories with me and my sister at night. I started reading kannada magazines (Taranga, Sudha and Mangala) and then Reader&rsquo;s Digest. Reader&rsquo;s Digest surely elevated my reading with all the humor and word exercises and also stories from people across the world. 
Along the way, I came across a weekly sports magazine <em>Sportstar</em>. While I enjoyed the stories on/of my favorite cricketers. I also discovered names like Mohammad Ali and Lance Armstrong. An account of Lance Armstrong over-coming cancer and winning seven <em><strong>Tour de france</strong></em>, which is considering to be the most endurance testing sport known to mankind, made me purchase my first real book, when I came to Bangalore for CET counselling, his Autobiography - <em>It&rsquo;s not about the bike</em></p>
<p>Since then I have developed almost a fetish for autobiographies. Some of my all time favorites are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Andre Agassi&rsquo;s - <em>Open</em></li>
<li>Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s - <em>The Story Of My Experiments With Truth</em></li>
<li>Viktor Frankl&rsquo;s - <em>Man&rsquo;s search for meaning</em></li>
<li>Paramahamsa Yogananda&rsquo;s - <em>Autobiography of a Yogi</em> - Probably the best book I have read thus far.</li>
<li>Helen Keller&rsquo;s - <em>The Story of my Life</em></li>
<li>Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s - <em>Mein Kampf</em> couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to complete as I found it bit too cruel.</li>
<li>Anne Frank&rsquo;s - <em>The Diary of a young girl</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Growing up, the now ubiquitous internet was nowhere. We didn&rsquo;t have power at our home, let alone a TV. So books were my only access to the outer world.</p>
<p>Autobiographies are two things: A window to the person&rsquo;s soul, they tell what they think about themselves, and also how they want the world to remember them.</p>
<p>I am also grateful to all all my English teacher&rsquo;s who epitomized the pinnacle of reading pleasure through names such as Oscar Wilde, William Blake, Wordsworth and of course the Bard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are the stories we tell ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ Joan Didion</p>
<p>My dad has taught and inculcated a few good things in me for sure. The best and most impactful of those certainly is the habit of reading.</p>
