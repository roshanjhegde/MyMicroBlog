			 <p>One day you will wake up, not as  a body,</p>
<p>But as a  pure soul.</p>
<p>You will awaken to who you really are, to your mission in this world and to the values that govern existence.</p>
<p>When you wake up, all the situations you have experienced will make sense.</p>
<p>There will be no more pain or sadness.</p>
<p>Your entire past will be seen with gratitude and each experience as necessary and important for your growth.</p>
<p>When you wake up, there will be no more guilt. You will realize that everything you did was in the terms of what  you had.</p>
<p>You will understand that you did the best you could and that your &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; were attempts to find yourself.</p>
<p>And all guilt will become love and forgiveness of oneself.</p>
<p>When you wake up, you will love yourself.</p>
<p>You will stop comparing yourself to others and you will realize your uniqueness.</p>
<p>Finally you will understand that the beauty of each one is in being what you are, and that no norm can give you the strength of beauty that is to be authentic.</p>
<p>When you wake up, you won&rsquo;t judge.</p>
<p>You will learn that each person is at a different level of evolution and even if the attitudes of others do not work for you, everyone has the right to try and learn from the consequences of their attitudes, because everyone is on the path of evolution.</p>
<p>When you wake up, you will value the present more, slow down your steps, express more what you feel and you will be open to the affection of those who love you.</p>
<p>You will look at all beings as souls, you will honor their existence, you will walk knowing that everything has a meaning and that a greater force moves your soul and your destiny.</p>
<p>When you wake up you will be in constant communion with the Universe and every gesture of yours will be a prayer.</p>
<p>We continue to live between  dreams  and open our eyes to reality and the depths of life.</p>
<p>Every situation we go through is a touch of life that calls us to wake up&hellip;</p>
<p>In the name of love!!</p>

			 <p>A young boy asked his grandfather,
&ldquo;Grandpa, I want to be a star, I want to be in movies. When I grow up, I want to see the world, drive nice cars, and live in a house made of glass. Yes, I really want to be successful and great. So tell me, how do I chase all my goals, and catch them faster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grandfather stopped for a moment, turned around, and then spotted a huge and super beautiful butterfly dancing on a flower. At once, he said,
&ldquo;Oh, my God! What a magnificent butterfly! Now, hurry&hellip; hurry and chase after it! Make sure you catch it! Don&rsquo;t let it fly away! Move!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lad hurriedly ran to the butterfly, but as he tried to take hold of it, the butterfly suddenly flew up into the wind. He ran after it, trying to catch it, but it was flying so fast. He ran around and around the garden until he got tired, and then he could no longer see the butterfly. Panting with loss of breath, he returned to his grandfather, wheezing,
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t catch it, grandpa! It flew away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grandfather smiled for a moment, then held the young lad by his hand and took him to a corner. He waited until he calmed down, then he whispered into his ear,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, boy, let me teach you a lesson, a valuable life lesson. If you spend your time chasing butterflies, they&rsquo;ll fly away. But if you spend your time creating a beautiful garden, the butterflies will come to you. You see&hellip; that butterfly is like your goals in life. In our journey of success, it&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in the pursuit of immediate goals, the fleeting butterflies of life. However, the real magic happens when we focus on building something substantial, akin to cultivating a vibrant garden. Instead of relentlessly chasing, channel your energy into creating and nurturing. Build something meaningful, whether it&rsquo;s a project, a skill, or a relationship. The beauty you will cultivate will attract opportunities, experience, and success naturally. So don&rsquo;t chase love, money, or success. Become the best version of yourself and those things will come to you.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>My eternal Mother,</p>
<p>Where do I begin and what do I say? Even as this humble human heart throbs in gratitude for the countless benedictions benevolently bestowed at your compassionate feet, many a doubt linger at the far corners of this questioning mind. After I spent over 30 years in the warm and tender embrace of your nurturing soil at last I manage to face my fears and take the plunge.</p>
<p>In writing to you I endeavor to understand the intricacies of my own existence while your infinite wisdom dispels the ignorance of my insignificance in the grand scheme of things. No words would suffice to express how greatly I feel about you. However, I feel morally obligated to write to you now more than ever as you are going through the mostly incredible time of your everlasting life.</p>
<p>I want to know mother how you came to be a true paradise of paradox. In you all the polar opposites seem to co-exist. It never seizes to amaze me, why would you nurture selfless souls who live for the sake of others while allowing corrupt crooks to thrive? Even as I attribute it to motherly compassion, I am confounded by the disparity of wealth distribution in your very home. How can you let a few loathe in richness while the many suffer their poverty in silence?</p>
<p>How is it that you make allowance for the hopes of hardworking heroes dashed while the dreams of the fortunate few are fulfilled? I can understand you giving birth to sons and daughters who further the frontiers of music and mathematics, but why bother to nurture terrorists and tyrants? How then do you ensure justice is served when injustice is rampant? On the one hand we as a nation strive for greatness while on the other we reek of meekness help me make sense of these confluence of conflicts.</p>
<p>Are you a but a mere fleeting mirage or an eternal unchanging reality? Am I to feel elated when the greatness of your glory soars over Himalayan heights or devastated when the character of my nation sinks into oceanic depths? It is incredibly gratifying to see you clad in pristine rivers and bejeweled with magnificent mountains. But then, I fail to reconcile all the impurities your children add-on to your clothes all the dents they cause into your ornaments. Is it greed or survival? Is it ignorance or innocence?</p>
<p>For all the questions that confound me, I would not have it any other way. For you are in me as much as I am in you; a culmination of contradictions and a miracle of creation. I am grateful to you for the gift of love, for the spark of life and for the light of knowledge that was vouchsafed upon me by the sole virtue of being born to you. Thank you for giving this opportunity to write to you and seek your blessings. Hope to hear from you sometime in the eternity.</p>
<p>Yours Forever,</p>
<p>Loving Child</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>For Whitehat Jr how do you improve the connect between the candidates and tutors after the first call?</p>
<p>Comprehend the Situation</p>
<p><strong>What</strong> : The conversion rate after the demo call is below satisfactory levels</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong>:</p>
<p>The children are <em>not</em> happy with the tutor
The parents are <em>not</em> happy with the tutor</p>
<p><strong>Clarifying questions</strong>:</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the duration of the demo?</p>
<p>Whats the structure?</p>
<p>Is there interaction?</p>
<p>Is there an internet connectivity issue?</p>
<p>What does the tutor focus on merely showcasing knowledge or building rapport?</p>
<h3 id="identify-the-customer">Identify the Customer</h3>
<p><em><strong>Customer: Parents of young children - since they are ones paying</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Note: The purist in me wants to say the child/learner is the customer, I would like to take a different path and want the reviewers to expound on the merits or lack thereof of this approach of identifying the customer. *</p>
<p>Also, in principle should the customer be the one using the product or the one paying for it(when they are different)? Example in the case of B2B product etc?</p>
<h3 id="report-the-cxs-needs">Report the CX&rsquo;s Needs</h3>
<p><strong>Assumption</strong>: the parent would assess whether the below objectives are met in the demo session by the tutor as far as the child is concerned.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is well behaved - polite and patient</li>
<li>Knowledgeable and able to transfer that knowledge according to age, inclination and aptitude of the child</li>
<li>Keeps the child engaged - through interaction</li>
<li>Enjoys and has fun interacting with the kids and vice-versa</li>
<li>Ensures learning is happening - through retention and recall</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cut-through-prioritization">Cut, through prioritization</h3>
<p>First priority,</p>
<p><strong>Enjoys and has fun interacting with the kids and vice-versa</strong></p>
<p>If the child is having fun,</p>
<p>It will stay engaged and it will learn. It will continue to do so for long periods of time consistently. Also, it becomes a pull where the child learns without any sense of conscious effort and is therefore likely to want to learn more and remain interested much longer than otherwise.</p>
<p>Next thing would be,</p>
<p>Is well behaved - polite and patient</p>
<p>The third,</p>
<p>Knowledgeable and able to transfer that knowledge according to age, inclination and aptitude of the child</p>
<h3 id="list-all-solutions">List All Solutions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Educate the tutors about learning pedagogy and on nuances of interacting with and educating kids</li>
<li>Seek feedback from those who didn&rsquo;t sing-up on why they did not with open ended questions</li>
<li>Improve on those and iterate</li>
<li>Keep an initial rapport building or get to know your customer session where the child and parent can share what they want and tailor the demo accordingly</li>
<li>Work towards making the tutors more kind and compassionate human beings and distill the wisdom on why its good,</li>
<li><em><strong>Incentivize the tutors for genuine interaction and not merely for closing the sale</strong></em>. Provide them autonomy and flexibility on how they want to do it and for how long. Encourage them to be collaborators and not competitors by sharing their learning and experience from interacting with other prospects.</li>
<li>Improve the quality of leads and prospects, thereby investing effort in client that are more likely to convert</li>
<li>Allow tutors to be open and honest about the limitations of their platform and service - parents are able to see through promises that are too good to be true</li>
<li>Provide time for parents to voice their concerns or queries and educate tutors on how to address them</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="evaluating-trade-offs">Evaluating trade-offs</h3>
<p>Given enough resources (funding, time) and pain tolerance - ability to withstand temporary setback</p>
<p>I would recommend solution 6.</p>
<p><strong>Incentivize the tutors for genuine interaction and not merely for closing the sale. Provide them autonomy and flexibility on how they want to do it and for how long. Encourage them to be collaborators and not competitors by sharing their learning and experience from interacting with other prospects.</strong></p>
<h3 id="summarize-your-recommendation">Summarize your recommendation</h3>
<p>With the core vision of transforming the online education landscape and not just making a quick buck, one can see a much deeper concern that can be addressed using the above problem statement as a starting point.</p>
<p>Which is to enjoy the process of learning and being able to have fun while doing it.</p>
<p>With that in mind, <strong>I would recommend incentivizing the tutors (possibly through equity ownership or ESOP) to build relationships and not approach the process with a transactional mindset</strong></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Some years ago, in the early stages of my career, there was a question posed to all the participants in the training session.</p>
<p>The question was, if you could any super power, what would it be and why?</p>
<p>Many people gave a variety of answers, some interesting, some predictable.</p>
<p>When I had a chance to speak, I said I would make everyone happy forever.</p>
<p>While being dismissed as impossible but good idea. I was asked the proverbial why?</p>
<p>I said, if you are happy, nothing else matters and if you are not, nothing matters then either!</p>
<p>Coming to think of it, it was not a bad superpower to have and probably much needed now.</p>
<p>It was only much later that I discovered that the great John Lennon echoed my words of wisdom ‚ò∫Ô∏è</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down &lsquo;happy&rsquo;. They told me I didn&rsquo;t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn&rsquo;t understand life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>Came across this beautiful poem by reading <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/06/28/may-sarton-the-work-of-happiness/">Marginalian</a></p>
<p>I thought of happiness, how it is woven
Out of the silence in the empty house each day
And how it is not sudden and it is not given
But is creation itself like the growth of a tree.
No one has seen it happen, but inside the bark
Another circle is growing in the expanding ring.
No one has heard the root go deeper in the dark,
But the tree is lifted by this inward work
And its plumes shine, and its leaves are glittering.</p>
<p>So happiness is woven out of the peace of hours
And strikes its roots deep in the house alone:
The old chest in the corner, cool waxed floors,
White curtains softly and continually blown
As the free air moves quietly about the room;
A shelf of books, a table, and the white-washed wall ‚Äî
These are the dear familiar gods of home,
And here the work of faith can best be done,
The growing tree is green and musical.</p>
<p>For what is happiness but growth in peace,
The timeless sense of time when furniture
Has stood a life‚Äôs span in a single place,
And as the air moves, so the old dreams stir
The shining leaves of present happiness?
No one has heard thought or listened to a mind,
But where people have lived in inwardness
The air is charged with blessing and does bless;
Windows look out on mountains and the walls are kind.</p>

			 <p>also the one you don&rsquo;t ask enough&hellip;</p>
<p>Have you been around 3 or 5 year old kids or are a parent of one?</p>
<p>If yes, then you would observe something interesting. They are compulsive Why&rsquo;ers or atleast most of them start out that way.</p>
<p>That is, all 5-year olds ask one question, <em>again and again and again</em>.</p>
<p>WHY??</p>
<p>I tell her not to eat chocolates, her response: why papa?</p>
<p>Other day we were all watching a üé• together and an actress was crying üò≠, she asked, why is she crying? I</p>
<p>We had to stop at the red light, and while we wait, she fired her why weapon a few times.</p>
<p>Why was the car red?</p>
<p>Why are so many folks on the road?</p>
<p>Why were there pot holes on the road? She answered this as well, saying I think they didn&rsquo;t construct it properlyü§£</p>
<p>I told her not to touch power sockets and her response was, you guessed it, why Papa?</p>
<p>The curiosity of a kid is wonderful (for the kind of questions) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSGf_vVKoI8">torturous</a> (because you know you will not have answers) at the same time.</p>
<p>While the inevitable institutionalisation (schooling &amp; society) is likely to drive out some of the curiosity out of every child, it may not be too late for us to stop.</p>
<p>Take a step back.</p>
<p>And ask <em><strong>why</strong></em>,  more often than we presently do.</p>
<p>After all, accomplished author and speak Simon Sinek became world famous, pivoted his career and had the breakthrough insight to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4">Start With Why</a></p>
<p>Or if you are still wondering why should you still worry about why! Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlYkx41wEE">Taiichi Ohno</a> the father of Toyota production system.</p>
<p>German philospher, Friedrich Nietzsche had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are still not convinced, here&rsquo;s another quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson an American philospher and essayist to ponder upon especially if you (like me) are working for a boss and might be one someday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The man who knows how will always have a job.
The man who knows why will always be his boss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides, he (she in this case) who has the last <em>why</em> also has the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSGf_vVKoI8&amp;t=4s">last laugh</a></p>

			 <p>While being stuck in traffic I saw a bunch of kids in a school playing by themselves.</p>
<p>One game in particular caught my attention. There was this one guy standing in the middle of the ground with his back bent. All the other boys would just run up to him, place their palms on his back and just jump over him.</p>
<p>He was happy and they were too.</p>
